          Technology and computers are the closest fields to me.
           'Passion and ambition' is the main driver for learning and progress in my field. 
           I am a person who loves to learn and gain experiences from everyone.
           I aspire to learn everything new, I want to benefit my community.

           I graduated from Princess Noura bint Abdulrahman University with a second honors degree,My graduation project 
           is Face Detection and Recognition, and itâ€™s has won One of the ten best graduation projects for the year 2019.
           At the beginning, I trained with several volunteer companies until I gained experience,
            and until I was prepared for real work, I trained at IBM and got an official job with them. 
            After five months of training, and after a year of work, 
            I got hired at SDAIA and completed a year with them, 
            And now I have been accepted into Tuwaiq BootCamps to develop web browsers using JavaScript
